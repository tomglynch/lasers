Web App Requirements for Audio-Responsive Laser Projection Visualization
1. Audio Input and Analysis
Microphone Input:

The app must listen to the computer’s microphone in real-time for audio input (preferably with a low-latency buffer).
It should be able to handle stereo and mono audio sources, with the ability to differentiate between left and right channels if needed.
Music Beat Detection and Audio Analysis:

The app must analyze the incoming audio to detect beats and frequency peaks.
It should be able to sync visuals (e.g., line movements or color changes) to the beat of the music, possibly using algorithms like FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) or any other real-time music beat analysis technique.
The response to the music should be dynamic, with audio features like tempo, pitch, and volume influencing the visual output.
2. Visuals for Projection (Laser-like Lines)
Full-Screen Mode:

The app must feature a full-screen mode that is mostly black, with laser-like lines or dots that emerge and move dynamically in response to the music.
These lines or dots should appear to shoot out of the center or specific points of the screen, mimicking the look of laser projections when shown through a projector.
The lines should be thin, high-contrast, and bright enough to be visible in a dark or low-light environment.
Laser-like Effect:

The app should create thin colored lines or dots that appear to move or pulse in time with the music. These lines should emanate from the center or other points on the screen and spread outward.
The lines should change color dynamically based on the beat or frequency analysis (e.g., bright red, blue, green, etc.).
The movement of the lines or dots should correspond to the beats of the music, creating the illusion of laser beams.
The projection should allow multiple lines or dots to appear simultaneously, each representing a separate laser line.
The app should ensure the visuals are designed so that when projected, the resulting effect looks like real laser lines (e.g., if there’s smoke or haze, the laser lines should be visible in the air).
3. Settings Panel (Non-Full-Screen Mode)
The settings panel should be available when the app is not in full-screen mode.
Customization Options:
Color scheme: Allow users to select or randomize the colors of the laser lines or dots.
Line behavior:
Control how lines or dots move (e.g., straight lines, curving paths, circular patterns, etc.).
Ability to adjust the speed at which lines expand or move to sync with the music's tempo.
Adjust line thickness and opacity for visibility control.
Control the number of lines/dots on the screen at any time.
Audio sensitivity: Adjust how responsive the visuals are to the beat and how strongly audio features like volume or bass influence the visuals.
Line formation: Ability to create different patterns or geometric shapes (e.g., grid patterns, radial designs, etc.) for the projection.
Sound input source: Option to select between microphone input or another audio source (such as a direct line-in or system audio).
4. Projector Compatibility
The app should be compatible with a projector setup to display the visuals in real-time.
Ensure the visuals are generated in a high-resolution format, with the ability to project both on standard screens and in specific environments where smoke or haze is present to create a laser-like effect.
The projection should maintain performance even at high frame rates (60fps or higher) for smooth visuals.
5. User Interface
Main Display: A black background with simple, intuitive laser-like visuals (dots/lines) that respond to music.
Settings Panel: Accessible via a toggle button or hotkey when the app is not in full-screen mode.
The settings should be organized into categories like Visuals, Audio, and Projection to allow easy navigation.
6. Performance & Optimization
Real-Time Performance: The app must run in real-time with low latency and smooth performance.
Cross-Browser Support: The app should work across major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
Resource Efficiency: Optimize for minimal CPU and memory usage, ensuring smooth performance even on lower-end machines.
7. Additional Features (Optional)
Preset Visual Patterns: Offer users the ability to choose from predefined visual patterns that sync with the audio.
Export Visuals: Provide an option to export the generated visuals as video files (for offline projection or editing).
Network Synchronization: For larger setups, allow synchronization with other instances of the app running on different machines, ensuring synchronized visual effects for multiple projectors.
Key Functional Flow:
Audio Input: The app receives and analyzes the audio from the microphone in real-time.
Beat Detection: The app detects beats, frequency peaks, and music characteristics.
Visual Generation: The app generates dynamic laser-like lines/dots on a mostly black screen based on the music analysis.
Full-Screen Mode: The app switches to full-screen mode for projection, ensuring visuals are optimized for projection (black background, laser lines).
Settings Adjustments: The user can adjust various settings (color, line movement, sensitivity, etc.) in the settings panel when not in full-screen mode.
